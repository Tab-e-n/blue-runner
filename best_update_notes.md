# 2.0.B THE BEST UPDATE

 - This is the BEST UPDATE. I have hit my _PEAK_. __There will be no need to update the game anymore__. This is the _last update_
   this GAME will RECIEVE for a while because it is __the__ BEST. ___I am the bestest videogamermaker___.

<details><summary><h2>OUTSIDE OF GAME BUT GAME RELEVANT</h2></summary><p>

 - The GAME has a LICENSE
 - Game is sold seperately.

</p></details>
<details><summary><h2>GAMEPLAY</h2></summary><p>

 - I haven't changed much in how the character plays. I mean, why improve on perfection am i right?
   However, the levels that i offered before weren't the best, i mean, most of them were fine,
   but there were some pacing issues, and level 14 was really bad as a final level. So i did the
   sensible thing and completely trashed all of them and made completely new ones. I didn't reuse any layouts
   no none at all.
 - Just jumping above spikes was boring so there are some minor new mechanics.
 - If you ever felt, like you experienced peak while playing SR, but you could take a picture of this
   peak???? The press F2! Just press it. Press it so many times the pictures completely fill your PC.
   Then you will find true happiness.
 - You can press F6 to save a replay of what you were doing. It ain't no picture, so you probably
   do not want to use this useless feature.

<details><summary><h2>VISUALS</h2></summary><p>

 - SR is nolonger in the 4:3 aspect ratio, but in the glorious ___5:3 aspect ratio___!
 - The game now sports a __new visual style__, i worked REALLY HARD on it, i hope you like it.
 - If you ever felt, like you can't see S1 or XT9 because they blend into the bisexualy lit 
   enviroment too well, then you can enable outlines to make them more visible.
 - Also NEW TREES OMG I LOVE THERES!!! THEY ARE SO COOL! (_EVEN COOLER THAN SHIFTING AROUND THE
   COLOR OF DIRT_)

(trees here)

<details><summary><h2>MENU</h2></summary><p>

 - Menu has been overhalled, it nolonger looks like shaky hand teenager mouse drawings, but instead
   what a teen would find cool for visual design. Which is an improvement, i think. (I hope)
 - Hey! I happy that you are reading this dumb text, hopefully it is atleast a bit funny. As a little
   reward for your time, here is a code you can use in the game: `PH0N35C4M`

</p></details>
<details><summary><h2>AUDIO??????????????</h2></summary><p>

 - You are nolonger in complete silence? What?!
 - This tech is revolutionary, if you ever felt, like a hollow person while playing SR because of this, it is no more.

</p></details>
<details><summary><h2>FIXES AND CHANGES</h2></summary><p>

 - I have fixed all bugs. They are all gone. If you ever felt, like you found a bug, don't send it to me, it has already been fixed. I got them all. Bang Bang.
 - The ___feature___ of being able to walljump of sawblades has been made more consistent.
 - Fixed herobrine.

<details><summary><h2>THE LEVEL EDITOR QUESTION</h2></summary><p>

 - The Level Editor has been a point of contention for quite a while, and by that i mean the exact opposite.
   Nobody uses it. Out of the 100% percent of players that play SR 0% have even opened the Level Editor.
   Its has also been a pain in the arse to develop, there hasn't been a day of making levels where some simple
   feature doesn't decide to pull one over on me and decide to not work. Like, i had to fix the playtest feature
   milions of times, and it always somehow stops working randomly. And also it gives my coding abilities a bad rep, have you seen thousand
   line scripts of spaghetti and shit? Don't look at it. It sucks. So all that and more made me decide to remove it.
   No more level editor. It will not exist going foward. It does not exist. It is a fabrication. It didn't exist.
   We made it up. It's fiction.
 - If you ever felt, like you wanted to use the editor, you didn't.

</p></details>
<details><summary><h2>THE WIKI QUESTION</h2></summary><p>

 - Unlike the level editor, the wiki is still going to stay. I have a plan to update it so it has all the info it lacks.
 - This plan will start about yesterday evening next year.

</p></details>
<details><summary><h2>THE MOD SUPPORT QUESTION</h2></summary><p>

 - It is well known that the MOD SUPPORT is not comming soon, and with the cancelation of the late LEVEL EDITOR,
   it is safe to say that MOD SUPPORT will join it in the #LevelEditorIsOverParty.

</p></details>
<details><summary><h2>FINAL WORDS</h2></summary><p>

 - If you ever felt, your gone enyoj this videotgame peak.
 - Peak.
 - Peak!
 - PEAK!!!
