# 2.0.B THE BEST UPDATE

This is the BEST UPDATE. I have hit my PEAK.__ There will be no need to update the game anymore__. This is the last update
this game will recieve for a while because it is the best. I am the bestest videogamermaker.

<details><summary><h2></h2></summary><p>
</p></details>
<details><summary><h2>OUTSIDE OF GAME BUT GAME RELEVANT</h2></summary><p>

 - The GAME has a LICENSE
 - Game is sold seperately.

</p></details>
<details><summary><h2>GAMEPLAY</h2></summary><p>

 - I haven't changed much. I mean, why improve on perfection am i right? However, the levels
   that i offered before weren't the best, i mean, some of them were fine, but there were some
   pacing issues, and level 14 was really bad as a final level. So i did the sensible thing and
   completely trashed all of them and made completely new ones.
 - The are new mechanics to spice up the new levels.
 - If you ever felt like you experienced peak while playing SR, but you could take a picture of this
   peak???? The press F2! Just press it. Press it so many times the pictures completely fill your PC.
   Then you will find true happiness.
 - You can press F6 to save a replay of what you were doing. It ain't no picture, so you probably
   do not want to use this useless feature.

<details><summary><h2>VISUALS</h2></summary><p>

 - SR is nolonger in the 4:3 aspect ratio, but in the glorious___ 5:3 aspect ratio___!
 - The game now sports a__ new visual style__, i worked REALLY HARD on it, i hope you like it.
 - If you ever felt, like you can't see S1 or XT9 because they blend into the bisexualy lit 
   enviroment too well, then you can enable outlines to make them more visible.
 - Also NEW TREES OMG I LOVE THERES!!! THEY ARE SO COOL! (EVEN COOLER THAN SHIFTING AROUND THE
   COLOR OF DIRT)

(trees here)

</p></details>
<details><summary><h2>MENU</h2></summary><p>

 - Menu has been overhalled, it nolonger looks like shaky hand teenager mouse drawings, but instead
   what a teen would find cool for visual design. Which is an improvement, i think. (I hope)
 - Hey! Since you made it here i will give you a secret code that can be used in one of the new menus.
   It is: (insert code here). Have fun with it!

</p></details>
<details><summary><h2>FIXES AND CHANGES</h2></summary><p>

 - I have fixed all bugs. They are all gone. If you find a bug, don't send it to me, it has already been fixed. I got them all. Bang Bang.
 - The___ feature___ of being able to walljump of sawblades has been made more consistent.

</p></details>
<details><summary><h2>THE LEVEL EDITOR QUESTION</h2></summary><p>

 - The Level Editor has been a point of contention for quite a while, and by that i mean the exact opposite.
   Nobody uses it. Out of the 100% percent of players that play SR 0% have even opened the Level Editor.
   Its has also been a pain in the arse to develop, there hasn't been a day of making levels where some simple
   feature doesn't decide to pull one over on me and decide to not work. Like, i had to fix the playtest feature
   milions of times, and it always somehow stops working randomly. And also has quite bad pr, have you seen thousand
   line scripts of spaghetti and shit? Don't look at it. It sucks. So all that and more made me decide to remove it.
   No more level editor. It will not exist goin foward. It does not exist. It is a fabrication. It didn't exist.
   We made it up. It's fiction.

</p></details>
<details><summary><h2>THE WIKI QUESTION</h2></summary><p>

 - Unlike the level editor, the wiki is still going to stay. I have a plan to update it so it has all the info it lacks.
 - This plan will start about yesterday evening next year.

</p></details>
<details><summary><h2>THE MOD SUPPORT QUESTION</h2></summary><p>

 - It is well known that the MOD SUPPORT is not comming soon, and with the cancelation of the late LEVEL EDITOR,
   it is safe to say that MOD SUPPORT will join it in the #LevelEditorIsOverParty.
