# 1.1.0 THE I FIX MANY F*** UPS UPDATE PATH NOTES

 - So the last update was... something to say at least. Lets hope this one is better!

## GENERAL

### VISUAL

 - The recoloring continues.
 - Also 2 pixels on the user universe logo weren't color in.

## SONIC RUNNER

### NEW ADDITIONS

 - When you launch SR from a console, you can now set the parameter --level with a path to a level and the game will start in that level instead of the loading sequence.
   Yes no one is gonna use this i know.
 - New loading sequence for SR.
	 - If you can't bind your keys through the options, (because you did a funny and bound everything to the same key)
	   you can now interupt this new sequence by pressing F12, which will allow you to rebind your keys.
 - You can now see exact stats for what levels you beaten, unlocked etc.
 - New character select menu! It is active when you have more than one character unlocked.
 - You can now unlock XT9 by collecting all 6 bonuses in waterway. (Not final)
 - When beating a level, it now shows you the levels par time.
 - The replay menu will now show where replays are located.

### VISUAL

 - Fixed the white pixel on the completion bar in the select menu.
 - When transitioning from level to level, the screen didn't go completely black.

### FIXES & CHANGES

 - Fixed a game breaking bug where the game would crash upon deleting a save, and the wasn't able to load.
 - The game now properly loads saves from version 0.X.
 - When you rebound keys, the select menu didn't show the newly rebound key.
 - Fixed the User Universe page system just not working. Like, at all.

 - You can now collect more than one collectible at a time.

 - Level_1--1 (float rock;) unlocks when you are 50% done with waterway. (Not final)

## SONIC RUNNER EDITOR

### MODS

 - **SAD NEWS**: In 1.1.0 mods are disabled. They didn't really work before anyway, but now they officialy don't work.
   I hope to make them work in a future update, but currently they are on hold.
 - All the things related to mods have now been put away into the corner ("developer" button), since they are kinda useless now.
 - You can now load .dat files in the .dat editor.
 - You can now set unlock requirements for characters.

### NEW ADDITIONS

 - You can now reset settings to default.
 - You can now press a button to start playtesting the level you are working on.
 - Pressing ctrl + the key you bound to save will now save the level without a popup if it was saved already.
   You can press shift + ctrl + save key if you want the popup.
 - By pressing alt + the key you bound to transform, you can randomize an objects scale and rotation.
	 - The range in which the object will be scaled to can be set in the options. If both options are the same,
	   it will only randomize rotation.
 - There are now shortcuts for changing layers.
 - You can now bind a key to exit the current screen and go back to the main menu.
 - Portals now aren't the only objects that can unlock things, collectibles now share this ability as well.
 - You can now set unlock requirements for level groups.
 - Unlock requirements for levels have been expanded.

### VISUAL

 - In the edit menu, when editing an objects unique properties, the text is now smaller, so it can fit more text.
 - If a objects unique property is uneditable with the edit panel, it now says so (SpinningArm and Track).
 - More objects now show their hitboxes.
 - There is new arrow attached to the cursor that shows the selected items rotation.
 - HoverText's point no longer scales up when scaling up the HoverText.
 - HoverText text offset now appears correctly.
 - Fixed finish not displaying the correct runner

### FIXES & CHANGES

 - In the options, setting the default level name would set the default author name and vice versa.
 - While you edit text, keyboard shortcuts won't do anything until you stop editing text.
 - When you select a new object or decor, it resets scale, rotation, z_index and color, instead of keeping them.
 - Objects placed outside the center layer had collision, which wasn't intended.
 - Using transform mode to rotate an object is now more reliable.
 - Fixed the ability to erase the background with the erase tool.

 - Ghost now always appears behind player.
 - The player visual will no longer be flipped when you change the the way it's facing.
 - You are now able to collect more than just one collectible per level playthrough.
 - HoverText no longer triggers if its touching something that isn't the player.
 - Fixed HoverText text offset not working if follow_player wasn't turned on.
 - Placing down a portal or light_point no longer crashes the editor.
 - You can also edit and remove a portal after you place it. This isn't related to it crashing the editor.
 - Fixed Track.tscn crashing SR and also not really working properly.

 - Changing the bg of a level group now actually does something in SR
