 - You can now change the font of HoverText.
 - New text interpreter or something!
	 - When typing text into HoverText, you can type some commands
	   inbetween %% and they will be replaced by game info.
	 - `%left%`, `%right%`, `%up%`, `%down%`, `%jump%`, `%special%`,
	   `%reset%`, `%return%` will be replaced by the users keybinds for
	   those actions.
	 - `%unlock [unlock]%` will be replaced by a YES or NO depending on if
	   `[unlock]` is unlocked.
	 - `%level [level_data]%` will be replaced by info from the level .dat file.
	   possible options for [level_data]:
		 - creator - Who made the level.
		 - level_name - Name of the level.
		 - level_icon - What icon the level has.
		 - level_base - What base the level has.
	 - If you wanna type % or any of the commands without them being replaced, put them between \`\`,
	   and the interpreter will ignore them.
	 - %\`% will put a \`, since otherwise it will be removed.
 - You can now set `tele_destination` of the portal and finish to `*Level_Next`, which will change the level to the next level in the level group.

 - The official tag now does nothing in UserUniverse.
 - The keybind for saving with a popup is now shown in full.
