### NEW ADDITIONS

 - Added a new object: Boosters! The act similarly to mushrooms, but just with different theming.
 - Added a new object: Platforms! The moving platforms are real!
 - You can now change the font of HoverText.
 - You can now set `tele_destination` of the portal and finish to `*Level_Next`, which will change the level to the next level in the level group.
 - You can now attach your name to a level group.

### VISUAL

 - There are now more variations of dirt tiles.
 - The .dat creator has been centralized.

### FIXES & CHANGES

 - The official tag has been altered. Now when a level has the official tag:
	 - If the levels author matches the level groups author, the level won't have the "Creator:" line, similary to how WaterWay doesn't have it.
	 - If the levels author is different to the level groups author, it will show a thank you message.
 - The official tag now does nothing in UserUniverse.
